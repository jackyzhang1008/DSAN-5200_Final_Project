"Notes"
"Premiums are monthly. Premiums were analyzed using the lowest-cost premium for each metal tier (bronze, silver, and gold) and the second-lowest-cost silver (benchmark) premium for a 40-year-old in each county and weighted by county plan selections. In some state-based marketplaces, the premium data for some years are at the rating area level and are mapped to counties before weighting by county plan selections. For more information on sources and methodology, see: [How ACA Marketplace Premiums Are Changing by County in 2023](https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/how-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-changing-by-county-in-2023/)."
